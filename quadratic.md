# Quadratic Equation

## Introduction

A quadratic equation is a fundamental equation in algebra that deals with second-degree polynomials.
These equations play a crucial role in various mathematical fields and real-world applications.

## Main Idea

In essence, a quadratic equation is an equation where the highest power of the unknown variable (usually represented by $x$) is $2$.
It can be written in the general form:

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

where:

* **$a$**, **$b$**, and **$c$** are constants, and **$a ≠ 0$**.

The solutions to this equation, also known as roots or zeros, are the values of **$x$** that satisfy the equation.

## Concepts

* **Standard form:** The equation is rearranged to have **$ax^2$** as the first term, followed by **$bx$** and a constant term **$c$**.
* **Roots/Zeros:** The values of **$x$** that make the equation true, resulting in a value of $0$ on the left side.
* **Discriminant:** A part of the quadratic formula that determines the nature of the solutions. It is denoted by **$b^2 - 4ac$**.

## Formula and Explanation

The **quadratic formula** provides a general solution for any quadratic equation:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

where:

* **$a$, $b$, and $c$** are the same coefficients from the standard form.
* **±** represents the "plus or minus" sign, indicating two possible solutions.
* **√** represents the square root.

**Explanation of the formula:**

* **-b/2a:** This part accounts for the linear term (bx) in the equation.
* **±√(b^2 - 4ac):** This part, known as the discriminant, determines the nature of the solutions:
    * **Positive discriminant:** Two real and distinct solutions.
    * **Zero discriminant:** Two real and equal solutions (repeated root).
    * **Negative discriminant:** Two complex solutions (non-real solutions).

### Demonstration Example

**Solve the equation:** 

$$2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$$

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

* **a = 2**
* **b = 5**
* **c = -3**

**Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula.**

$$x = \frac{-{5} \pm \sqrt{{5}^2 - 4 \cdot {2} \cdot {-3}}}{2 \cdot {2}}$$

**Step 3: Simplify the calculation.**

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4}$$

**Step 4: Find the solutions.**

$$x = \frac{-5 \pm 7}{4}$$

Therefore, the solutions are:

* **x = 1**
* **x = -\frac{3}{2}**

### Common Pitfalls

* **Not rearranging the equation to the standard form before applying the formula.**
* **Misinterpreting the discriminant and its implications for the solutions.**
* **Making calculation errors while solving the formula.**

### Limitations

* The quadratic formula only applies to equations where the highest power of the variable is 2.
* It doesn't provide information about the behavior of the equation (e.g., vertex, positive/negative intervals) without further analysis.

### Extensions

* Completing the square: An alternative method for solving quadratic equations.
* The quadratic formula can be extended to solve higher-order polynomial equations with specific structures.
